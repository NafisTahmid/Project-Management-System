## Project Hosting Documentation

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and hosting the Django project locally, along with instructions on pushing it to GitHub.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- Virtual Environment

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` and `yourrepository` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd yourrepository
    ```

---

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

1. Create a Virtual Environment for the project:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

    - For **Windows**:

      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - For **macOS/Linux**:

      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

    You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

---

## Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

1. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If `requirements.txt` is not already present, you can generate it by running:

    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Step 4: Set Up Database

1. Run migrations to set up your database:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel (optional):

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Follow the prompts to create the admin user.

---

## Step 5: Install Additional Libraries (if required)

If you've installed additional libraries such as `crispy_forms` and `crispy-bootstrap5`, ensure they are included in `requirements.txt` and installed as part of your dependencies.

For example:

```bash
pip install crispy-forms crispy-bootstrap5
